This class List inherits some basic list methods from class BasicADT. Because BasicADT only has 2 pure virtual functions - these are implemented here, along with the typical unsorted List methods.

This list is a fixed size array that holds integer numbers. 

main.cpp tests getLength, remove, insert, and retrieve methods.

Functions were also implemented to check if the list is empty or move items.
